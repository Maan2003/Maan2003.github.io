      I was accepted for “<strong
        >Graphical Wallet for
        <a href="https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint">Fedimint</a> using
        WASM”.</strong

    </p>
    <p>
      Fedimint is an experimental implementation of federated e-cash written in
      Rust. Currently, there is only a CLI client. A GUI client will be crucial
      for widespread adoption, allowing non-technical people to use MiniMint.
      Packaging the client as Web Assembly will help make more native clients
      such as an Android app.

      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      Compiling Rust to Web Assembly is very simple. We just need to avoid
      crates that don’t work on Web Assembly. We had to remove and update some
      crates.

    <h3 id="async-runtimes">async runtimes</h3>
    <p>
      Minimint uses <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a> runtime, which is not
      compatible with Web Assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, we have
      <a
        href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/js-promises-and-rust-futures.html"
        >wasm-bindgen-futures</a
      >
      that allows to interop between Rust Futures and JavaScript Promises. We
      just had to add some
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fedimint/minimint/commit/fb2b140c6540e70d6081acd9693cfcd16d3d75a3"
        >helper functions</a
      >
      to replace the tokio usage.

      Disentangling mint-client from minimint server
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mint client depended on the server for various type definitions and
      modules. I fixed this by
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fedimint/minimint/commit/6c8edb1200297ac11a207aad553d03fa9e0ced94https://github.com/fedimint/minimint/commit/6c8edb1200297ac11a207aad553d03fa9e0ced94"
        >separating out a minimint-core</a
      >
      that both server and client can depend on.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Minimint server uses http for its API. Each module can expose api
      endpoints. Due to http, we had to use polling to fetch transaction. With
      web sockets, we will use jsonrpc for fully async request and responses.

      A bunch of changes later and bug squashes later, paying and recieve
      lightning payments works!

      I would like to thank my mentor

      for helping me throughout this and for quick responses and reviews.
